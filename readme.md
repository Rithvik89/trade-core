Assumption 1: We have Inf stocks of each player

1. So we will have 2 stocks per player, 1st innings stock and 2nd innings stock. This decision is taken because a better cannot be expected to be bought at the same base price of his batting ability when his side is fielding ( People may even want to buy him in 2nd innings but at the ability of his 2nd innings skill)

2.  Activity-Driven Pricing

    Example: After a player gets out, their Stock 1 price remains tied to achievements like “Max Fours” or “Best Strike Rate,” creating speculative value.
    Price decay slows for stocks tied to ongoing awards, keeping them active in trading.

Elements like : 
1. Max fours
2. Max sixes
3. Highest score
4. Best Strike Rate
5. Winning team captain
6. Most wickets
7. Most Economical
8. Most Catches

All the above elements as well add value to a player after match, So this prevents users from easily selling a player back after he got out.
